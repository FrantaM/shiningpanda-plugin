<div>
  Runs a shell script in the selected Python environment for building the project.
  The script will be run with the workspace as the current directory. Type in the contents of your shell
  script.
  <p>
  By default, the shell will be invoked with the "-ex" option. So all of the commands are printed before being executed,
  and the build is considered a failure if any of the commands exits with a non-zero exit code.
  <p>
  As a best practice, try not to put a long shell script in here. Instead, consider adding the shell script
  in SCM and simply call that shell script from Jenkins (via <tt>bash -ex myscript.sh</tt> or something like that),
  so that you can track changes in your shell script.
